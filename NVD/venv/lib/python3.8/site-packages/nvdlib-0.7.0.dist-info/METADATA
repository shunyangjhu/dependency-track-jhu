## Simple NIST NVD API wrapper library

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nvdlib/badge/?version=latest)](https://nvdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**NVDlib** is a Python library that allows you to interface with the [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD), pull vulnerabilities (CVEs), and [Common Platform Enumeration](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) (CPEs) into easily accessible objects.

<br/>

### Features

- Search the NVD for CVEs using all parameters allowed by the NVD API (only version 1.0 right now). Including search criteria such as CVE publish and modification date, keywords, severity, score, or CPE name.
- Search CPE names by keywords, CPE match strings, or modification dates. Then pull the CVE ID's that are relevant to those CPEs. 
- Retrieve details on individual CVEs, their relevant CPE names, and more.
- Built in rate limiting according to [NIST NVD recommendations](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers). <br> Get an API key (https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) to allow for 0.6 seconds between requests. Otherwise it is 6 seconds between requests.

### Install
```bash
$ pip install nvdlib
```


### Demo
```python
>>> import nvdlib
>>> r = nvdlib.searchCVE(cveId='CVE-2021-26855')[0]
>>> print(r.v31severity + ' - ' + str(r.v31score))
CRITICAL - 9.8
>>> print(r.descriptions[0].value)
Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2021-26412, 
CVE-2021-26854, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065, CVE-2021-27078.
>>> print(r.v31vector)
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H 
```


### Development

Run the tests with

```bash
$ pip install -e '.[dev]'
$ pytest
```

#### More information

This is my first attempt at creating a library while utilizing all my Python experience from classes to functions.
